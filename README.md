PlugIT
======

PlugIt is a framework enhancing the portability and integration of web services requiring a user interface.

We use this framework at EBU to access web services on the EBU.io platform.

***This is a draft of the protocol and implementation. Except issues (and report them) !***

## Django client

This repository contains an hors-de-la-boite django application to access a PlugIt server. No setup should be needed (django has to be installed however).

Use `cd Simple Django client` and `python manage.py runserver` to run the project. The interface is available at http://127.0.0.1:8000/

It's possible to change the default location of the PlugIt server (_http://127.0.0.1:5000_) in the app/settings.py file.

## Flask server

The flask server implement a PlugIt server.

server.py is the main flask file, providing different call to the framework, generated from actions defined in actions.py. Basic configuration is available at the beginning of the file. Otherwise, this file **should not be edited** !

Use `cd Simple Flask server`and `python server.py` to run the server.

### Available option
* _DEBUG_ : Boolean. Set to True to active flask debugging
* _PI_META_CACHE_ : Number of seconds to ask the EBUio server to cache the meta information. Set by default to 0 if _DEBUG_ is True, 5 minutes if _DEBUG_ is False.

### actions.py
The user can implement his actions in the actions.py file. Each action is a defined like this

```
@action(route="/test", template="test.html")
def test(request):
    return {"hello": "Test", "data": request.args.get('data', '')}</code>
```

It's possible to use various additional decorators to specify how the meta about the action is generated:

* `@only_logged_user()`: Make action available only for logged users
* `@only_member_user()`: Make action available only for members users
* `@only_admin_user()`: Make action available only for admins users
* `@cache(time=0, byUser=None)`: Specify how and how long the action should be cached
* `@user_info(props=[])`: Specify the list of properties requested about the user

Again, the server.py file take care of responding to /meta/, /template/ and /action/ call. The function in actions.py will be called when needed. The request is passed as the first parameters to actions.

### media/
The media folder contains all media files

### templates/
The template folder contains all templates


# Templates
Each template can extend the template _plugIt/base.html_. The template integrates basic JavaScript and CSS libraries such as jQuery, Bootstrap and integrate into the generic EBUio interface.

Templates use the django templating language. The documentation is available at https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/topics/templates/

An _ebuio_u_ object is provided, with the current user.

A _ebuio_baseUrl_ value is provided, with the root URL to use for all URL generation (others actions, medias, etc..)


# API Methods

Each method returns a JSON object, except for /template/ and /media/ calls.

If you use our Flask server, those method are automatically implemented !

## Basic methods

### /ping [data=OptionalData]
/ping is used to test access to the application. The server must reply with an HTTP 200 response and the object {data: _OptionalData_} if everything is ok. The _OptionalData_ must be returned if provided, as send by the client or with a blank string if the parameter wasn't set.

### /version
/version is used to get the current version of the server API. The server must reply with an HTTP 200 response and the object {result: 'Ok', version: '1', protocol: 'EBUio-PlugIt'}, for the current version, if everything is ok.

## Actions' methods
The project can define multiples actions, and they are triggered from the templates. There is no definition of the available actions.
The default action, called when the user arrive on the project page on EBUio is defined by a blank string. (root)

### /meta/_action_
This call returns information about a specific action. The server must reply with an HTTP 200 response (or a 404 if the action doesn't exist) with an object. Properties of this object are:

* template_tag : String. The current version of the template. This value must change if the template associated with the action change.
* only_logged_user : Boolean. Optional, default to False. True if the user must be authenticated on EBUio to call the action.
* only_member_user : Boolean. Optional, default to False.  True if the user must be in the project group on EBUio to call the action.
* only_admin_user : Boolean. Optional, default to False.  True if the user must be an administrator of the project on EBUio to call the action.
* cache_time : Integer. Optional, default to 0. Time, in seconds, on how long the page should be cached on the EBUio side.
* cache_by_user : Boolean. Optional, default to _only_logged_user_ parameter. Set to true if the page must be cached by user. Useful if the page change based on the current user.
* user_info : List of string. Optional, default to []. List of user properties EBUio add to each request. Example properties, the full list isn't defined yet: username, email, first_name, last_name.

The server should set the Expire: _Date_ HTTP header. EBIio will cache the result of the called based on this header. If this header isn't set, a timeout of 5 minutes will be used.

### /template/_action_
This call returns the template for a specific action (no JSON !). 200 HTTP status code must be used if everything is ok, or an HTTP 404 if the action doesn't exist.

### /action/_action_
This call execute on the server the specific action. If a POST method is used on the EBOio side, the request is done to the server using the same method, otherwise using GET.

POST data and URLs parameters are forwarded to the server side, including files, but parameters begging by ebuio_ are removed.

EBUio add to parameters (Using GET or POST data, depending of the method of the request) each parameter requested about the user in ebuio_u_<parameterName> parameters. One should be careful about lengths of those requests.

The server should reply with an HTTP 200 status code (or 404 if the action doesn't exist, 403 if the user hasn't right to call the action). The returned JSON object is forwarded to the template.

### /media/_medianame_
This call return a specific media on the server side. Each request on EBUio side on /media/* is forwarded to the server and returned to the client. No caching is used, but a 1 hour Cache-Control header is set by EBUio-
